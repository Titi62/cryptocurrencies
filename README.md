The difficulties that have recently emerged in trade with digital currencies may not be resolved by one person , but it will certainly be difficult to cooperate with all those involved in this field . It is only enough to know the solution and abide by its rules so that the digital currencies can be established in the market and use them as capital in trade and transfers , not as an increase in incremental profits .
In order to be able to use it in fast business , the transfer rate from one person to another must be quick and at the moment and be separable .( i.e. that accounts should not be left behind and money is not remitted to someone else .)and energy consumption in this transport and transmission is very low .
The three problems that have already been known for the transfer of money and to make digital money in the business market need to be considered as a solution to the three problems . For this purpose , I propose a solution to address these problems , which in different parts of which I examine the three issues .

The exchange market and transfer ofÂ  crypto currencies should be carried out in two layers .The upper and higher layer will include routine transactions and sales , which must act like data transfer on the Internet , and operate in a network of minimal barriers and minimum energy consumption , shopping information , and transfer of money .While integrated and continuous , the network must hold transmission lines in secure channels , such as e - mails and similar information , transfer currencies from account to other accounts .
