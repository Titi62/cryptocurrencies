# Save cryptocurrencies energy
The difficulties that have recently emerged in trade with digital currencies may not be resolved by one person , but it will certainly be difficult to cooperate with all those involved in this field . It is only enough to know the solution and abide by its rules so that the digital currencies can be established in the market and use them as capital in trade and transfers , not as an increase in incremental profits .
In order to be able to use it in fast business , the transfer rate from one person to another must be quick and at the moment and be separable .( i.e. that accounts should not be left behind and money is not remitted to someone else .)and energy consumption in this transport and transmission is very low .
The three problems that have already been known for the transfer of money and to make digital money in the business market need to be considered as a solution to the three problems . For this purpose , I propose a solution to address these problems , which in different parts of which I examine the three issues .

The exchange market and transfer of  crypto currencies should be carried out in two layers .The upper and higher layer will include routine transactions and sales , which must act like data transfer on the Internet , and operate in a network of minimal barriers and minimum energy consumption , shopping information , and transfer of money .While integrated and continuous , the network must hold transmission lines in secure channels , such as e - mails and similar information , transfer currencies from account to other accounts .
In the lower layer containing personal accounts , there should be more security and there is no need for continuous connection to the upper network and can operate as hard as computers and hard drives , which has the ability to store safe storage.Digital wallets are now operating this way , but the problem is that it 's more like a chest and not smart .In the case of this context , the upper and lower network is smart and connected , and there is no need for separate commands and direct planning of certain digital exchange management .
In the current system for money transfer , each digital currency has its own calculation and performance in the system in its own way , and it consumes a lot of time and energy to get out of its system and into another digital exchange environment , and the problem is exactly the same .The mismatch and entry and exit to the separate system of any digital currency causes an imbalance and decrease of transmission speed.Now , if the currencies are in the form of a certain system , they will carry out transfers in a higher layer and money of daily transactions not to enter the depth of the crypto currency system and there will be surface transfers ,Much of the computation and energy is reduced and its speed increases dramatically , also for most of the currencies currently running high .
It is only when the money goes into the bottom of the network , or the same reservoirs , or the offices of the digital currencies , which require the permanent registration and storage of it in the individual 's personal chest .To avoid excessive use of this system per day , one can take two to three days to record it , so that one does not repeatedly decide to place a place in the bottom layers .
In the proposed case , instead of the different platform for each digital currency , we move them into the same network for transmission and make it simple and fast .The example is that in the old day's programming you used basic programs , the programming was hard and time consuming , and perhaps there were mistakes in the program , but today 's programming is done in a much easier way and with faster programs ,in order to make it suitable for today 's volume - to - date applications .It may be the root of these new programs in old applications , but it runs more rapidly in the upper layer .
In this case , to find the root of accounts in such transfers as the roots are clear and fixed , they can easily be tracked by tracking them into the original account . It's like the roots of the head that are fixed and can be a sign of sorting out the seemingly abandoned hair .It means that , however busy the network is , it can be tracked by connecting it to its roots in the bottom layer .
The finished transfers to be more comfortable in the resolution should be removed from the channels and remain the only transfers in the current , while the remaining redundant transitions remain in place for security issues .
The ability to trace the transport route is also possible .Business owners and manufactures should know that the best mode for healthy and profitable business is transparent business and all owners of digital currencies and manufactures and sellers have to be supportive of a system that is traceable .Otherwise , the system will be recognized by the people and the market and the governments not safe and cannot be funded .
These two layers and networks were for transfers . But miming of  crypto currency's argument is hot in the use of energy consumption .While excessive mining and without control of crypto currencies also causes problems of generating without production , which must be controlled at the beginning of the action.Among the rules that have to be put up for crypto currencies is in the mining sector of these currencies .
First , the mining of currencies should be limited and dependent on production. So that the producers who sell their goods in the cryptocurrency will have the right to miming that crypto to the ratio of their sales and the use of that cryptocurrency . If they have the power to mining that currency with renewable energies , they will only be allowed to use this type of energy in the mining of currencies .These laws have to be met with universal trust that can attract everyone 's confidence towards these currencies . If part of them is followed by a number of people , it does nothing to do and the market will remain the same .
